## Bugs

## TO DO

- Make `$.Plugin.prototype.parent` easier to access
- Allow options to instantiate each separately or as one item
- Create generic `extend()` on Functions which is used in `.extend()`?
- Add a `.clone()` method for duplication plugins
- Any pending tests
- Add UMD for testing with command line
- Add check for Backbone to be able to use `Backbone.View` in place of `$.Plugin`?
- If the element doesn't exist on the page, create it
