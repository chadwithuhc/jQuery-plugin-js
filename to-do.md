# Plugin.js
A better jQuery plugin boilerplate system using Backbone-like syntax.

## Bugs

## TO DO

- Make `$.Plugin.prototype.parent` easier to access
- Allow options to instantiate each separately or as one item
- Create generic `extend()` on Functions which is used in `.extend()`?
- Any pending tests
- Add UMD for testing with command line
- Add check for Backbone to be able to use `Backbone.View` in place of `$.Plugin`?
